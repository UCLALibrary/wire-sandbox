One of the most common design challenges we face is providing learners with a set of pathways for learning that include a quick overview of a set of possibile next steps, and then the option to dig deeper and learn more about specific topics.

The [materialize css framework](https://materializecss.com/) gives us a few options to explore - and we often find ourselves trying to compare and gather feedback on which of these options to choose in different scenarios. 

Let's look at an example from our current reading strategies project. How can we provide learners with quick overview of a bunch of reading strategies, and then allow them to dive in and learn more about each strategy? Also for this project, we're thinking about how to present both text and media together for each strategy.

<h3>Cards</h3>

<div class="card">
    <div class="card-image waves-effect waves-block waves-light">
      <img class="activator" style="max-height: 300px;" src="/assets/images/paraphrase-title.png">
    </div>
    <div class="card-content">
      <span class="card-title activator grey-text text-darken-4">Paraphrase as you read<i class="material-icons right">videocam</i></span>
      <p>Summarizing content in your own words ensures that you have understood the text and helps you remember what you’ve read.</p>
            <ul class="browser-default">
                <li>Whenever you encounter an important concept, paraphrase it in your notes or outline.</li>
                <li>Avoid summarizing using the exact words in the text, taking notes verbatim is not nearly as effective as writing in your own words.</li>
                <li>A few words or a sentence will suffice for each summary.</li>
            </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="card-reveal">
      <span class="card-title grey-text text-darken-4">Paraphrase as you read<i class="material-icons right">close</i></span>
